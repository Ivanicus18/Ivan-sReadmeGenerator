    ## Description
    This is in an application for taking user-generated data and turning it into a readable and useable README for Github repositories. Utilizing the node.js platform, users are guided through a series of code prompts that collect the information required to fill out the sections of the README. Once all the prompts have been answered, the application collates the collected data and inputs it into a template literal that will structure the content, depositing the finished product into an easily locateable location within the source folder.
